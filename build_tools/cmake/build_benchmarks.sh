# Build benchmark suites using a host tools directory.
#
# The required IREE_HOST_BIN_DIR environment variable indicates the location
# of the precompiled IREE binaries.
#
# Designed for CI, but can be run locally. The desired build directory can be
# passed as the first argument. Otherwise, it uses the environment variable
# IREE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS_DIR, defaulting to "build-benchmarks". It reuses the
# build directory if it already exists. Expects to be run from the root of the
# IREE repository.
